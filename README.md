A code for simulation the evaluation of  microbunched electron beam in drift section
There are two calculation models.The "LSC_Drift2" is based on the analytical method to get longitudinal electric field E_z using bunching factor,proposed by DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.134802. "LSC_Drift1" is a modified version,the E_z is calculated by fft of the current distriubution per step,which has proved more general for any case.
