A code for simulation the evaluation of  microbunched electron beam in drift section
There are two caculation models.The "LSC_Drift2" is based on the analytical method to get longitudial eletric field E_z by bunching factor,porposed by DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.134802. "LSC_Drift1" is modified version,the E_z caculated by fft of the current distrubution per step,proed more general for any case.
